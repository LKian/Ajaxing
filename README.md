## Styling

### Sass

To install Sass globally, used NPM. Run the following command in the terminal

```sh
npm install -g sass
```

[Installation](https://sass-lang.com/install)

After setting up the initial folder and file structure, open the terminal and type the command

```sh
sass --watch assets/scss/main.scss assets/css/main.css
```

[Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

The watch command tells SASS to watch main.scss SCSS file for changes and compile into main.css.

modified folder structure so files are all in a `fontawesome` folder rather than loose files within `scss`.
